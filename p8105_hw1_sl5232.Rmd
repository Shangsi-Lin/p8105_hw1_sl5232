# Problem 1
## Load data and tidyverse

```{r chunk_setup}
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```



```{r}
summary(cars)
```



```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
